--🧠 C. Conditional, CASE, and DECODE (10 Questions)
--1.Categorize customers into income tiers: Platinum, Gold, Silver, Bronze.

select 
   cust_id,
   cust_first_name||' '||cust_last_name as names,
   cust_income_level,
   case
    when cust_income_level  like '%: 30%' then 'bronze'
    when cust_income_level  like '%:50%' or cust_income_level  like '%:70%' then 'silver'
    when cust_income_level  like '%130%' or cust_income_level  like '%150%' or cust_income_level  like '%170%' then 'gold'
    else 'platinum'
    end as income_categories
    from sh.customers;

--2.Display “High”, “Medium”, or “Low” income categories based on credit limit.

select 
   cust_id,
   cust_first_name||' '||cust_last_name as names,
   cust_credit_limit,
   case
    when cust_credit_limit > 8000 then 'high'
    when cust_credit_limit between 3000 and 8000 then 'medium'
    else 'low'
    end as income_categories
    from sh.customers;

--3.Replace NULL income levels with “Unknown” using NVL.
    
 select 
      cust_id,
      cust_first_name||' '||cust_last_name as names,
      cust_income_level,
      nvl(cust_income_level, 'unknown') as income_level
      from sh.customers ;


--4.Show customer details and mark whether they have above-average credit limit or not.

select 
   cust_id,
   cust_first_name||' '||cust_last_name as names,
   cust_credit_limit,
   case
    when cust_credit_limit > 6000 then 'above_average'
    else 'not_above_average'
    end as credit_categories
    from sh.customers;


--5.Use DECODE to convert marital status codes (S/M/D) into full text.

select
   cust_id,
   cust_first_name||' '||cust_last_name as names,
   cust_marital_status,
   decode (cust_marital_status,'single','s',
   'married','m','divorced','d') as marital_status_full
   from sh.customers;


--6.Use CASE to show age group (≤30, 31–50, >50) from CUST_YEAR_OF_BIRTH.

with age_as as 
(select 
   cust_id,
   cust_first_name||' '||cust_last_name as names,
   cust_year_of_birth,
   (2025 - cust_year_of_birth) as age
   from sh.customers)
   select 
       cust_id,
       cust_year_of_birth,
       age,
       case
        when age <= 30 then 'below 30'
        when age between 31 and 50 then 'between 31 and 50'
        else 'greater than 50'
        end as age_status
        from age_as;

--7.Label customers as “Old Credit Holder” or “New Credit Holder” based on year of birth < 1980.

 select 
       cust_id,
       cust_year_of_birth,
       case
        when cust_year_of_birth < 1980 then 'old credit holder'
        else 'new credit holder'
        end as credit_status
        from sh.customers;

--8.Create a loyalty tag — “Premium” if credit limit > 50,000 and income_level = ‘E’.

select 
       cust_id,
       cust_credit_limit,
       cust_income_level,
       case
        when cust_credit_limit > 7000 and cust_income_level like 'E%' then 'premium'
        else 'not premium'
        end as loyalty_tag
        from sh.customers where cust_income_level like 'E%';

--9.Assign grades (A–F) based on credit limit range using CASE.

   select 
     cust_id,
     cust_first_name||' '||cust_last_name as names,
     cust_credit_limit,
     case
       when cust_credit_limit = 1500 then 'A' 
       when cust_credit_limit = 3000 then 'B'
       when cust_credit_limit = 7000 then 'C' 
       when cust_credit_limit = 9000 then 'D'
       when cust_credit_limit = 11000 then 'E'
       when cust_credit_limit = 15000 then 'F'
       else 'null'  
       end as limit_range
       from sh.customers;



--10. Show country, state, and number of premium customers using conditional aggregation.
   
   select 
     country_id,
     cust_state_province,
     sum(case when cust_credit_limit > 6000 then 1 else 0 end) as premium_credit_case
     from sh.customers 
     group by country_id, cust_state_province
     order by country_id, cust_state_province;
